# Opinion Dynamics. Relative agreement model or how can extremism prevail?

[Implementation of Deffuant bounded confidence model](https://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/5/4/1.html)

## What is done?

* Implemented basic model and agent classes in __**p2p** regime_ - randomly selected interactions with other agents._
* Implemented custom scheduler for providing correct behaviour.
* Implemented **UNOPTIMAL** agent in _**all** regime - every agent interact with **all** others._
* Implemented extremism behaviour, (03.04 -- some crucial fixes)
* Add basic visualizations of model simulation.
* Add convergence analysis.
* Create metric for clustering similarity. Implemented Deffuant indicator.

## Further work
* Run several experiments to analyze model behaviour.
* Design up ML model to avoid large and long runs of provided model
